# 🛠️ Solana Workshop Kit

Build on Solana with AI in minutes — **clone, add your key, run opencode.** No install scripts, nothing touched outside this folder.

This one self-contained kit bundles the [solana.new](https://www.solana.new) skills (32 of them: idea → build → launch)
ready for **[opencode](https://opencode.ai)**, wired to a shared **OpenAI-compatible** LLM endpoint.
Each student uses their **own** API key, so nobody burns someone else's budget.

Everything lives **inside the repo**: the skills are in `.claude/skills/`, the provider config is in `opencode.json`.
opencode discovers them automatically when you run it from this folder — there's nothing to install.

## ⚡ Quickstart (3 steps)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone <THIS_REPO_URL> solana-workshop-kit
cd solana-workshop-kit

# 2. Set YOUR key (you each get your own — never share or commit it)
export LITELLM_API_KEY=sk-...your-own-key...

# 3. Run opencode FROM this folder (it auto-loads the skills + provider)
opencode
```

Don't have opencode yet?

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

In opencode, pick the model **`rapidscreen/claude-sonnet-4-6`** (the cheaper one) and try:

> *"What should I build for the Solana hackathon?"*

Type `/` to see the bundled skills — they also **auto-activate** based on what you ask.

## 💸 Models & cost

Your key is on a shared LiteLLM proxy with a **$25 budget**. Two models — **use Sonnet**, it's cheaper on every axis:

| Model | Input / 1M | Output / 1M |
|---|---|---|
| **`claude-sonnet-4-6`** ✅ default | **$3** | **$15** |
| `claude-opus-4.6` | $5 | $25 |

The default in `opencode.json` is already set to Sonnet.

## 🧠 What you get — 32 skills

| Phase | Skills |
|---|---|
| **Idea** | find-next-crypto-idea · validate-idea · competitive-landscape · defillama-research · colosseum-copilot · solana-beginner · learn |
| **Build** | scaffold-project · build-defi-protocol · build-data-pipeline · build-mobile · launch-token · debug-program · build-with-claude · product-review · roast-my-product · design-taste · frontend-design-guidelines · …and more |
| **Launch** | deploy-to-mainnet · create-pitch-deck · submit-to-hackathon · apply-grant · marketing-video |

Just ask in plain English (*"scaffold my project"*, *"roast my product"*, *"deploy to mainnet"*) — the matching skill kicks in.

## 🔐 Key handling (important)

- Your key is **personal**. The `.env` file is **gitignored** — never commit a real key.
- **Set the key in the same shell you launch `opencode` from.** opencode does **not** prompt for a missing key —
  if `LITELLM_API_KEY` is unset it becomes an empty string and every request just returns a confusing **401**.
  A new terminal tab loses the export, so re-set it there.
- Easiest: `export LITELLM_API_KEY=sk-...`. Or copy `.env.example` → `.env`, fill it in, then
  `set -a && source .env && set +a` (opencode does **not** auto-load `.env`, so you must source it yourself).
- `opencode.json` references the key as `{env:LITELLM_API_KEY}` — the key itself is never stored in this repo.

## 📦 What's in the kit (nothing hidden, nothing global)

```
solana-workshop-kit/
├── opencode.json          # litellm provider + default model (sonnet)
├── .claude/
│   ├── skills/            # all 32 skills (auto-discovered by opencode)
│   └── data/              # shared knowledge base the skills read
├── .env.example           # key placeholder
├── .gitignore             # ignores .env
└── README.md
```

This kit installs **nothing** on your system — no global skills, no `~/.codex`, no telemetry, and it never
edits your `~/.claude/settings.json`. Delete the folder and it's gone. opencode (and Claude Code) read
`.claude/skills/` straight out of the cloned repo.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- **401 / auth error** → `LITELLM_API_KEY` is empty or unset in the shell you launched opencode from. opencode does **not** prompt — an unset var silently becomes an empty key. Re-run `export LITELLM_API_KEY=sk-...` in **that same terminal**, then `opencode`.
- **Provider/model missing** → run `opencode` from **inside** this repo (or a subfolder of it) so it picks up this repo's `opencode.json`.
- **Skills not showing** → make sure the folder is a git repo (a clone always is) and you're inside it; opencode finds `.claude/skills/` by walking up to the git root.
- **Catalog lookups** → solana.new's public bundle omits the `data/catalogs/*.json` ecosystem catalogs, so `navigate-skills` / `competitive-landscape` fall back to live web search — same behaviour as the official install.
- **Prefer Claude Code?** It reads the same `.claude/skills/` — just run `claude` from this folder instead.
